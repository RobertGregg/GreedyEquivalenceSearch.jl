# DAG → CPDAG
####################################################################

"""
    DAGtoCPDAG(dag::Graph) -> Graph
 
Convert a DAG to its **CPDAG** (Completed Partially Directed Acyclic Graph)
using Chickering's (2002) edge-labeling algorithm.
 
The CPDAG is the unique graph that represents the Markov equivalence class
of `dag`:
- **Compelled edges** must have the same orientation in every DAG that is
  Markov-equivalent to `dag`; they remain directed in the CPDAG.
- **Reversible edges** can be flipped without leaving the equivalence class;
  they appear as undirected edges in the CPDAG.
 
## Algorithm outline
 
1. **Consistent ordering** – sort the directed edges of `dag` by the
   topological rank of the child node (ties broken by the parent's rank).
   This ensures that whenever `z→x` and `x→y` are both edges, `z→x` is
   processed before `x→y`.
 
2. **Label each edge** – for every edge `x→y` in the ordering apply two rules:
 
   - **Rule 1 (compelled chain)**: if any `z ∈ pa(y)`, `z ≠ x`, has `z→x`
     already labeled *compelled*, then label `x→y` as *compelled*.
 
   - **Rule 2 (non-adjacent parent / v-structure)**: if any `z ∈ pa(y)`,
     `z ≠ x`, is not adjacent to `x`, then `x→y←z` is (or forces) a
     v-structure. Label `x→y` *compelled*, and propagate *compelled* to
     every other unknown edge into `y`.
 
   - If neither rule fires, label `x→y` as *reversible*.
 
3. **Assemble the CPDAG** – compelled edges stay directed; reversible edges
   become undirected.
 
## Examples
 
```julia
# V-structure: 1→3←2, with 1 and 2 non-adjacent → both edges compelled
dag = Graph(3)
addEdge!(dag, 1, 3)
addEdge!(dag, 2, 3)
cpdag = DAGtoCPDAG(dag)       # 1→3, 2→3  (directed)
 
# Chain: 1→2→3 → both edges reversible
dag = Graph(3)
addEdge!(dag, 1, 2)
addEdge!(dag, 2, 3)
cpdag = DAGtoCPDAG(dag)       # 1-2-3  (undirected)
 
# Fork: 1←2→3 → both edges reversible
dag = Graph(3)
addEdge!(dag, 2, 1)

cpdag = DAGtoCPDAG(dag)       # 1-2-3  (undirected)
